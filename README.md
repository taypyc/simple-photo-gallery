# Photo Gallery application

The application is made using the ReactJS library and without using any UI component libraries.

Components are styled using the Styled Components library (CSS in JS method).

The following tools were also used: AXIOS for API requests, React Router for routing the application (in the demo image replaced by Hash Router, which is more friendly with GitHub Pages), Redux Persist for saving data in Local Storage.

Implemented: the main page, the gallery page, a modal window that opens by clicking on a photo, the ability to add to Favorites and a page with favorite photos.

1) Clone the repository to your computer (by executing the command: <b>git clone git@github.com:taypyc/simple-photo-gallery.git</b> in the terminal);
2) Run the application using the <b>npm run start</b> command

The application will be available at: <http://localhost:3000/> in the browser.
